# Cryptocurrency-Market-Analysis

## 📚 Project Description

This project analyzes real-world cryptocurrency data loaded into **Snowflake** from a CSV file. Using **SQL**, we clean, transform, and analyze key metrics such as market cap, trading volume, and price dynamics.

Through various queries, we aim to uncover insights about market structure, investor behavior, and potential trading opportunities.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed `$` and `,` symbols from `current_price`, `market_cap`, `total_volume`.
- Converted text fields to numeric fields using `TO_NUMBER(REPLACE(...))`.
- Created a `CLEANED_CRYPTO` view for efficient querying.

## 📋 Key Business Insights

- Bitcoin dominates both price and market cap but others (Ethereum, Tether) dominate liquidity and trading volume.
- Stablecoins provide significant liquidity despite low volatility.
- Several low-cost assets (e.g., XRP, Dogecoin) are heavily traded, suggesting high retail activity.
- A few coins contribute disproportionately to total market cap (Pareto Principle: 80/20).
